# transfer_learning

The goal of this repository is to set up a dataset with world cuisine images and labels to experiment with transfer learning (TL) and hierarchical learning (HL). We seek to expand the capacity of nutrition CV to include predictions for non-western foods that many existing deep learning models currently have mastered. Due to the limitations in size of data we seek to explore TL and HL as potential approaches to get accurate predictions.

Scraping includes scripts for gathering image data from all-recipes world cuisines

Surveys includes ipy notebooks that explore transfer learning

Data includes urls collected from the scraping scripts
