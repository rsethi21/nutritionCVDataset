# nutritionCVDataset

The goal of this repository is to set up a dataset with world cuisine images and labels to experiment with transfer learning (TL) and hierarchical learning (HL). We seek to expand the capacity of nutrition CV to include predictions for non-western foods that many existing deep learning models currently have not mastered. Due to the limitations in size of data we seek to explore TL and HL as potential approaches to achieve accurate predictions from smaller datasets.

Scraping includes scripts for gathering image data from all-recipes world cuisines

Data includes urls collected from the scraping scripts
